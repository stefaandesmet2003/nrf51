# nrf51
useless fun projects based on nrf51822

My totally useless experiments & learning exercises with a cheapo smartwatch I got as a xmas gift from work.
The device has a nrf51822 hardware variant, 64x32 oled display, KX022 accelerometer, button, buzzer, battery & on-board charger
in a tiny package that opens with screws, no need to cut glue, nice!
the pcb has solder pads for GND,VCC,DIO,CLK,Tx & RX, everything you need to connect the ST-LINK programmer (debugger), and 
a serial-to-USB converter for simple printf debug output

/readout/* : info concerning the readout of the read-protected original firmware & how I eventually got the original firmware back working on the device
